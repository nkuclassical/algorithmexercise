Coding is fun, especially dealing with algorithm.
Here are my solutions to solving partial challenges from
- Leetcode
- Hackerrank
- ProjectEular

And I also realize design my own data structure(though they already exist)
is essential for a professional software developement engineer. They are:
- HashMap
- Queue
- Random Queue
- Linked List
- Double Linked List

Writing plenty of algorithm challenges is not just aim to tech interview,
but also can help my code readable, match code style, concise and elegant.
